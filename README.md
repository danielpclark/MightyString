[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/mightystring.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/mightystring)

Powerful methods for your strings.

Install: `gem install mightystring`

*Some extras to consider*
 * MightyString::HTML.text provides a more ideal HTML to ASCII formatting output.  This is an advanced block "filtering" module.  It works very well with, currently, extremely rare cases that fall through it's fingers.  Regardless it's beautiful, and will strive to be more so.
 
Look at the test/mightystring_test.rb for case usages of each feature.
