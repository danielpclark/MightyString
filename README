MightyString
by Daniel P. Clark

Description: Add (some) array functionality to strings and other string tools: Matching, Indexing, Substitution, Deletion, and more."

Pain points this solves.
 * After working with Python, ruby strings are lacking... so lets spiff them up.
 * Strings are Arrays... I mean really, think about it.  This works toward making strings function as Arrays.
 * Also additional string tools that shouldn't be a part of string are under MightyString... like strip_html.

My method.
  I believe code should be beautiful, simple, and well rounded.  No animals were harmed in ... err I mean no
regex was used in the making of this library.

Some tools to consider here.
 * MightyString::HTML.strip_html provides a more ideal HTML to ASCII formatting output.  This is an advanced
block "filtering" module.  It works very well with, currently, extremely rare cases that fall through it's
fingers.  Regardless it's beautiful, and will strive to be more so.
